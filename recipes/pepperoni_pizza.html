        <h1>The Best Pepperoni Pizza Recipe!</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>First, on the dough: Don't get overwhelmed! If it's your first time making pizza at home, <em>just buy the dough</em>. You can usually find pizza dough at the <strong>grocery store</strong>, or some pizza places will sell you a one-pound ball of dough for a few bucks.</p>
        <p>There are so many different kinds of pepperoni in the store these days, and you can use any of those options for pizza. For my money, though, I prefer small, thinly sliced pepperoni so they get a nice char on top. If you go with thicker pepperoni slices, you'll have a chewier texture. It's personal preference!
           I always find it lame when I get a pepperoni pizza that has, like, five pieces of pepperoni on it. But if you pile on a ton of pepperoni, you end up with a greasy mess.
           So what to do? Chop up half the pepperoni and add it in a layer under the cheese with the sauce!</p>
